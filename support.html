            <p>This is the official community hub for users of all CloudBreak products. This space, powered by GitHub Discussions and Issues, is designed for you to connect with other users, ask for help, share your projects, and propose ideas.</p>
            
            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-5">What is this space for?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>‚ùì Get Help:</strong> Ask questions and get answers from the community.</li>
              <li><strong>üí° Share Ideas:</strong> Share tips, tricks, and best practices you've discovered.</li>

            <div class="notification is-warning is-light">
              <p>To keep our products affordable, we do not offer free, one-on-one technical support. This forum is the primary way to get help, and it relies on <strong>peer-to-peer (user-to-user) assistance</strong>.</p>
              <ul class="mt-3">
                <li>This is <strong>not</strong> an official support channel with guaranteed response times.</li>
                <li>The user community, not the CloudBreak team, is the first line of support here.</li>
                <li>Please be respectful and patient. Everyone here is helping in their spare time.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-5">Team Engagement & The Tip Jar</h3>
            <p>While our official policy is community-led support, members of the CloudBreak team are passionate about serving our users and will often browse these forums.</p>
            
            <p>If a team member provides exceptional help that saves you significant time or solves a critical problem (or you just like what we do), you can show your appreciation through our tip jar:</p>

            <p class="is-size-7 has-text-grey"><em>Please note: Tipping is entirely optional and is a way to say "thank you" for help that goes above and beyond. It is not an entitlement for priority support.</em></p>
            
            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-5">Code of Conduct</h3>
            <p>To ensure this remains a welcoming and productive environment, please adhere to a few simple rules:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Be Respectful:</strong> Treat everyone with kindness and respect. No harassment or insults.</li>
              <li><strong>Be Clear:</strong> When asking a question, provide as much context as possible (e.g., error messages, what you've already tried, relevant code snippets).</li>
              <li><strong>Be Helpful:</strong> If you know the answer to someone's question, don't be afraid to jump in!</li>
              <li><strong>Stay On Topic:</strong> Keep discussions relevant to the CloudBreak ecosystem.</li>
