            <p>To keep our products affordable, we do <strong>not</strong> offer free, one-on-one technical support. Our community forum is the primary way to get help, and it relies on <strong>peer-to-peer (user-to-user) assistance</strong>.</p>

            <div class="has-text-centered mt-6">

            </div>

            <h3 class="title is-4">Details</h3>

            <ul class="mt-3">
              <li>The community forum is <strong>not</strong> an official support channel with guaranteed response times.</li>
              <li>The user community, not the CloudBreak team, is the first line of support on the community forum.</li>
              <li>Please be respectful and patient. Everyone on the community forum is helping in their spare time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-5">Team Engagement & The Tip Jar</h3>

            <p>While our official policy is community-led support, members of the CloudBreak team are passionate about serving our users and will often browse these forums to assist.</p>

            <p>If a team member does provide exceptional help that saves you significant time or solves a critical problem (or you just like what we do), you can show your appreciation through our tip jar:</p>

            </div>

            <p class="is-size-7 has-text-grey"><em>Please note: Tipping is entirely optional and is a way to say "thank you" for help that goes above and beyond. It is not an entitlement for priority support.</em></p>
